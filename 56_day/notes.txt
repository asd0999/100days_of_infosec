make a flag.txt file in /
make a dir notes in the dir where the script lives

open python prompt and unpickle

import pickle
f = open('payload', 'rb')
data = f.read()
print pickle.loads(data)

and the flag.txt file should be copied the notes folder

the ctf challenge is in python3 so need to pickle with that so the web app can unpickle and give me the flag
