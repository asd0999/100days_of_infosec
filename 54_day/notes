b * 0040090f //je instruction
set $ZF = 1
ni

since the flag == 1 je will not be satisfied???



gdb cant disassemble mian cuase this ELF executable is stripped
binja can tell you where main is but f you wanted to find out without binja
objdump -d -M intel recurse.bin | grep main

this will give you the libc main funciton which cannot be stripped
the first arhgument to libc main function will be the address of the main function
the first argument is stored in register rdi
the instruction above the call is

  4006bd:	48 c7 c7 c0 08 40 00 	mov    rdi,0x4008c0

so 0x4008c0 is where the main function starts, wow!

je is same as jz which means that it jmps if zero flag == 1/set/true
yes ZF = 1 means the test eax, eax result was 0
