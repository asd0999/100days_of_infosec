What I know so far:

the site is vulnerable to php filter base 64
i have leaked the source code for login, welcome, about pages
login is interesting, there is some SQL stuff in there
i also tried leaking a page called 'admin' as a guess which worked
source code releaved that i can only go to the admin page if sessionId exists and is == 1 (?)
also theres a directory /uploads/ that only admin has access to (?)

SQLi has not worked - neither manual nor sqlmap - this probs not a SQLi challenge

tried brute forcing with some common passwords - didnt work - dont think thats the way to go anyway
back to SQL injection (?)
what else can i look at

leaking the db was as simple as /db.sql
