give_shell function first instruction is at address 0x0040069d
I need to overflow the ret add to that address


python -c "print'A'*40 + '\x9d\x06@\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'" | ./boffin => did not work

so it did work cause in gdb we can see that the rip reaches the correct address in the give_shell function
but the program still crashes, probably something to do with the function prologue and the fact that it is being called from main()

so instead of overflowing the ret addr to the first instruction in the give_shell function, lets try 
overflowing the ret addr to the first instructtion after the function prologue 
ie the instruction that starts setting up the parameters for the system call to run execve

yes that worked!!! ok cool!!! :)
