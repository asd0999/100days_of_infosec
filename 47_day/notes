b * 0x00000000004007b4 // at the cmp instruction
set $eax = 0x30
ni

and you get "correct!" but this wont work on the server
so...
lets analyse...

read (1, rbp-0x50,0x40) reads from fd 1 for 0x40 bytes and stores the value in rbp-0x50 address. on success returns a 0 in rax

so rbp-0x50 has the value i enter

then 0 moved into rbp-0x54
jmp next instruction

mov that o into eax
cmp eax with 0x2f => 0x0 - 0x2f
if that is <=0, jmp left branch

mov 0 into eax
dereference [rax+0x601080] and mov 1 byte into eax
rax is 0 so click on 0x 6010180
99 is hte first byte, mov into eax which al 

99 is 1100011
not  99 is 0011100
which is 28
mov 28 into edx

mov 0 into eax
mov 1 byte from [rbp-0x50+rax] into eax
rax = 0 and rbp-0x50 is the buffer
so 1 byte from what i entered into eax
basically al
cmp edx (28) and eax (what i entered)
if equal, jmp to left branch and increment rbp-0x54 by 1

repeat the whole branch starting at address 0x004007b1



ok write some psuedo code now to solve this
